## Introduction

Deep learning is one of the most popular trends in the machine learning space these days, and there are many fields and applications where it stands out, such as driverless cars, speech and image recognition, robotics and finance. Deep learning is a set of algorithms that is inspired by the shape of our brain (biological neural networks), and machine learning and cognitive scientists usually refer to it as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

Predictive maintenance is also a very popular area where many different techniques are designed to help determine the condition of an equipment in order to predict when maintenance should be performed. In predictive maintenance scenarios, data is collected over time to monitor the state of an equipment with the final goal of finding patterns to predict failures. Among the deep learning methods, [Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) networks are especially appealing to the predictive maintenance domain due to the fact that they are very good at learning from sequences. This fact lends itself to their applications using time series data by making it possible to look back for longer periods of time to detect failure patterns.

In this tutorial, we build a LSTM network for the data set and scenerio described at [Predictive Maintenance](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Collection/Predictive-Maintenance-Template-3) to predict remaining useful life of aircraft engines. In summary, the template uses simulated aircraft sensor values to predict when an aircraft engine will fail in the future so that maintenance can be planned in advance.

This tutorial uses [keras](https://keras.io/) deep learning library with Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit [CNTK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/Using-CNTK-with-Keras) as the backend.

## Prerequisites

- An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) (free trial subscriptions are available).
- An installed copy of Azure Machine Learning Workbench with a workspace created.
- For model operationalization: Azure Machine Learning Operationalization with a local deployment environment setup and a [model management account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/model-management-overview)


## Let's Begin

To run on your local machine, from the AML Workbench `File` menu, select either the `Open Command Prompt` or `Open PowerShell` CLI. Within the CLI windows execute the following commands:

`az ml experiment prepare --target docker --run-configuration docker`

 We suggest running on a  DS4_V2 standard [Data Science Virtual Machine for Linux (Ubuntu)](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/microsoft-ads.linux-data-science-vm-ubuntu). Once the DSVM is configured, you need to run the following two commands:

`az ml computetarget attach --name [Desired_Connection_Name] --address [VM_IP_Address] --username [VM_Username] --password [VM_UserPassword] --type remotedocker`

`az ml experiment prepare --target [Desired_Connection_Name] --run-configuration [Desired_Connection_Name]`

With the docker images _prepared_, open the jupyter notebook server either within the *AML Workbench* notebooks tab, or to start a browser-based server, run:
`az ml notebook start`

- Notebooks are stored in the `Code` directory found in the Jupyter environment. We run these notebooks sequentially as numbered, starting on (`Code\1_data_ingestion.ipynb`).

- Select the kernel to match your [Project_Name]_Template [Desired_Connection_Name] and click Set Kernel

## Task 1: Data Ingestion & Preparation

The Data Ingestion Jupyter Notebook `Code/1_data_ingestion_and_preparation.ipnyb` loads the three input data sets into pandas dataframe format, prepares the data for the modeling part and does some preliminary data visualization. The data is then transformed into `PySpark` format and stored in an Azure Blob storage container on your subscription for use in the next modeling task.

## Task 2: Model Building & Evaluation

The Model Building Jupyter Notebook `Code/2_model_building_and_evaluation.ipnyb` reads the `PySpark` train and test data sets from blob storage. Then a LSTM network is built with the training data sets. The model performance is measured on the test set. The resulting model is then serialized and stored in the local compute context for use in the operationalization task.

## Task 3: Operationalization

The operationalization Jupyter Notebook `Code/3_operationalization.ipnyb` uses the stored model from the previous step and builds the required functions and schema for calling the model on an Azure hosted web service. This notebook further tests these functions, and zips the operationalization assets into a zip file that is also stored in your Azure Blob storage container. 

## Conclusion
This tutorial serves as a guide for beginners looking to apply deep learning in the predictive maintenance domain within the Jupyter notebook environment in *Azure Machine Learning Workbench*. This tutorial uses a simple scenario where only one data source (sensor values) is used to make predictions. In more advanced predictive maintenance scenarios such as in [Predictive Maintenance Modeling Guide](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Notebook/Predictive-Maintenance-Modelling-Guide-R-Notebook-1), there are many other data sources (i.e. historical maintenance records, error logs, machine and operator features etc.) which may require different types of treatments to be used in the deep learning networks. Since predictive maintenance is not a typical domain for deep learning, its application is an open area of research.
